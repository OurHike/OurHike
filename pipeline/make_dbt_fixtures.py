"""Tiny synthetic raw layers for the CI dbt job (pipeline/DBT.md's CI plan).

CI has no fetched data and must not fetch any (TESTING.md: no real network,
no large data), so the dbt build there runs against a handful of
code-generated features shaped like the real layers - the same field names
load_raw.py and the staging models read off the real fetch
(GlobalID/Name for ATC's ANST_Facilities family, dbid/title/icon for
opentrail). Every documented opentrail icon appears once, so the
accepted_values test on the raw column and the seed join both exercise
their whole domain.

WHERE THE NON-A.T. FIELD NAMES COME FROM, since nothing here can reach the
live services: every column below is a name sources.json records as MEASURED
against the live layer, with a date - the `notes` field lists for
nynjtc_long_path and nynjtc_highlands_trail (2026-08-24), mohonk_trails
(2026-08-25), oprhp_trails (2026-08-18), oprhp_facilities and the DEC layers
(2026-08-27), usfs_trails, usfs_rec_sites and nh_granit_trails
(2026-09-02), plus the structured `name_field`/`blaze_field`/`id_field`/
`public_field`/`asset_field`/`facility_field` keys, which are the same
measurements in machine-readable form. Nothing here is invented, and where a
layer's fields are NOT recorded the fixture carries none rather than a guess
- `oprhp_park_polygons` is that case and is deliberately property-free.

The VALUES follow the same rule where a domain was measured, because a
fixture that only ever shows the happy case proves nothing about the dirt:
DEC's MARKER carries a blank and the undeclared 'ORANGE AND RED' that
sources.json records on the live 5,286 rows; DEC's FOOT carries both Y and
M; PUBLICUSE carries an N so the flag the staging models pass through has
something to say; Mohonk's Blaze includes the 'N/A' string and a row with no
Blaze key at all (7 such rows measured on the live 304); NYNJTC's Long Path
Blaze is the lowercase 'aqua' all 43 real rows read; and OPRHP's ParksApp
carries both sides of its 5,822/3,000 split. NH GRANIT's BLAZE is the
sharpest case of the rule: it is a blank STRING on 7,574 of the live 7,643
Whites rows - because the Whites largely are not blazed, not because the
column is unpopulated - so most of that fixture's rows carry `' '` rather
than a colour, and the one that does carry White is the A.T. USFS's
`trail_type` carries SNOW beside TERRA for the same reason, and its
`national_trail_designation` spreads 1/2/3 across a single named trail
because that is what CRAWFORD PATH really does.

Refuses to write into a directory that already has one of its files:
this exists to fill an empty CI workspace, not to overwrite a real fetch.

    THE POINT OF THIS FIXTURE IS THE BLANK BLAZE, WHICH IS A REAL VALUE AND
    NOT A HOLE. Across the live 7,643 segments in the Whites, BLAZE reads a
    literal blank on 7,574 of them - 99.1% - against White 62, Yellow 4, Red 2,
    Blue 1. That is not an unpopulated column: the White Mountains largely do
    not use paint blazes, so a Whites trail having none is the normal case, and
    61 of the 62 White rows carry TRAILSYS 'Appalachian Trail' - the A.T. being
    the one white-blazed line through the range. reference/blaze_mapping.json
    maps the blank to "None" ("Unblazed") rather than to "Unknown" ("Blaze not
    recorded") for exactly that reason.

    It is a blank STRING and not a null, which is the distinction a staging
    model would get wrong first and which the mapping table's key depends on,
    so the majority of rows here carry `' '` verbatim. A fixture that populated
    the column would misrepresent the region.

    `PED` is the opposite case and needs its own row shapes: blank is
    UNRECORDED, not "no" (3,883 rows '1' against 3,760 blank), and 2,541 of
    those blanks carry no use flag at all while 1,209 are snowmobile corridors.
    So the fixture carries all three shapes - PED '1', blank-with-no-flags, and
    blank-with-SNOWMBL - because a `PED == '1'` filter would drop the middle one
    and that is the mistake nh_granit_trails' foot_comment exists to prevent.
    `MAINTORG` is a coded integer whose domain GRANIT does not publish - the
    codes here are live values, and what any of them means is unknown."""
