"""Lewis & Clark Trust: suggested hikes, drawn from nps/suggested_hikes.py's `nps_things_to_do and
nps_tours` (decision 54 wave 3, section C, 2026-10-04).

NPS's things to do (`/thingstodo`) and tours (`/tours`) lands once, in nps/suggested_hikes.py, read
whole, nationally, so park code `lecl` is in it, and dbt assigns this folder its portion by each
row's own park list matched to nps_alerts' `park_codes` map, the one home for which folder draws on
which park (decision 34). It needs NPS_API_KEY; without it the table is withdrawn, never read as
empty (extract/_json_apis.py, 'THE KEY').

The note this replaces read, whole:

Lewis and Clark Trust: suggested hikes, published, and not landed (coverage audit 2026-10-01, batch
c11_nht).

Restated from reference/org_coverage.json, whose text is trimmed where it ends in '…'.
