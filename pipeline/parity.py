"""Shadow-run parity: a family's file from today's exporter against the dbt writer's, record by record.

    python parity.py podcasts --new data/processed/podcasts_episodes.json
    python parity.py stewards --new data/processed/stewards.json
    python parity.py elevation --new data/processed/dbt/elevation_profile.json --raw-dir data/raw

pipeline/ELT.md, "How a rule moves: shadow-run parity", is the design: both
paths read the same input, records are paired by their key, and each
record's canonical JSON (keys sorted, whitespace gone) is compared. The
answer is the list of (key, old, new) differences, never a count, so a
reviewer can see where they are and classify each one: expected by a
decision, an improvement, or a defect in the new path.

Whitespace, key order and the trailing newline are not differences. A
record's place in the list is, for a family whose order is published (the
podcast list is shown in the file's order), and so is every top-level field
beside the records.

A FAMILY JOINS by a row in FAMILIES: how to get the old document, where its
records are, and what keys them. The old document comes from the exporter's
own builder, not a file it wrote, when the exporter has one that needs no
network, as export_podcasts.build_document does.

Exit 1 on any difference, so a CI step fails on one.
